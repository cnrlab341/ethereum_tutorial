To: Where we’re sending the ether to (in this case the smart contract)
Value: How much we’re sending in Wei
Gas: Gas is a measure of the computational effort that goes into executing a transaction on Ethereum. In this case we’re specifying an upper limit on how much gas we’re willing to go through to execute this transaction.*
Gas Price: How much we’re willing to pay (in Wei) per unit of Gas.
Nonce: This is an address nonce rather than the more commonly referred to Proof of Work. It’s simply a count of how many previous transactions the sending address has made, and is used to prevent double spending.
Chain ID: Each Ethereum Network has its own chain ID — the main net has an ID of 1, while Ropsten’s is 3. You can find a longer list here.
